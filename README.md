# Tech task
## Objectives

    **Create a todo-list application. Which includes next functionality:**
        *  Create a todo-item with a title, description, priority fields and a default status - open;
        * Edit all todo-item fields;
        * Move todo-item in done status;
        * Delete todo-item
        * Search todo-item by title;
        * Filter todo-item by status;
        * Filter todo-item by priority.
    **For task implementation you must use:**
        * pure JavaScript (ES6, ES next) with Babel transpiler (if needed) without frameworks;
        * any CSS pre/post processor (ex. Sass / Scss / Post-CSS / ...);
        * any module bundler (ex. Webpack / Rollup / ..);
        * any other technologies that youâ€™d like
    **Your application should be based on Wireframes provided in the Arch notes section**

## Arch notes

    * Empty state: Empty state

    * Filtered state: Filtered list state

## Acceptance criteria

    * Only JavaScript should be used for task implementation;
    * JavaScript code should be lintered with airbnb/javascript style guide;
    * Any CSS pre/post processor should be used for task implementation;
    * Any module bundler should be used for task implementation;
    * Usage documentation should be provided in a README file;
    * The solution should be placed on your own GitHub account;
    * The solution should be placed on GitHub pages;
